    <title>UProf - A Userspace Profiling Toolkit</title>

    <section id="uprof-intro">
      <title>About UProf</title>

      <para>UProf is a toolkit for profiling applications and libraries with an
      emphasis on domain specific instrumentation. Unlike tools like oprofile
      which don't require modification of code but can't customize reports to
      the applications being examined; uprof supports you, the developer, in
      adding timer and counter probes at the points you know are critical to
      your project so that you always have easy access to those numbers that
      really matter to you.</para>
