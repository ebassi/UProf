/**
 * uprof_context_new:
 * @name: The top most name to categorize your profiling results
 *
 * This creates a new profiling context with a given name. After creating
 * a context you should declare your timers and counters, and once
 * you have accumulated data you can print the results by creating a report
 * via uprof_report_new(), uprof_report_add_context() and uprof_report_print()
 *
 * For example:
 * |[
 *    UProfContext *context;
 *    UProfReport *report;
 *    UPROF_STATIC_TIMER (parent_timer,
 *                        NULL, // no parent
 *                        "Parent timer",
 *                        "An example parent timer",
 *                        0 // no application private data);
 *    UPROF_STATIC_TIMER (timer,
 *                        "Parent timer",
 *                        "Simple timer",
 *                        "An example timer",
 *                        0 // no application private data);
 *
 *    uprof_context_init (argc, argv);
 *
 *    context = uprof_context_new ("Test Context");
 *
 *    UPROF_TIMER_START (context, parent_timer);
 *    sleep (1);
 *    UPROF_TIMER_START (context, timer);
 *    sleep (1);
 *    UPROF_TIMER_STOP (context, timer);
 *    UPROF_TIMER_STOP (context, parent_timer);
 *
 *    report = uprof_report_new ("Test Report");
 *    uprof_report_add_context (context);
 *    uprof_report_print ();
 *    uprof_report_unref ();
 *
 *    uprof_context_unref ();
 * ]|

/**
 * uprof_context_link:
 * @context: A UProfContext
 * @other: A UProf context whos timers and counters you want to be made
 *         available to @context.
 *
 * Links two contexts together so the timers and counters of the
 * @other context will become in a way part of the first @context - at
 * least as far as reporting is concerned. For example calling
 * uprof_context_foreach_counter() would iterate all the counters of
 * other contexts linked to the given context.
 *
 * One example for linking contexts is for mainloop based libraries
 * that can optionally run under the control of an external mainloop.
 * In this case where it can't be predetermined who will own the
 * mainloop UProf provides a shared context just for the purpose of
 * tracking mainloop statistics which by convention everyone should
 * use. If you need to track mainloop statistics you should link
 * UProf's mainloop context into your own. See
 * uprof_get_mainloop_context() for more details.
 *
 * Another case where linking contexts can be useful is if you are
 * profiling a library that itself dynamically loads a shared object
 * (DSO), but you can't export a context symbol from the library to
 * the DSO because it happens that this DSO is also used by other
 * libraries or applications which can't provide that symbol.
 *
 * The idea is that the DSO can create its own UProf context without
 * depending on a symbol being exported from the library and then that
 * library can get a handle on the statistics collected by that
 * library at runtime via UProf and link the DSO context into the
 * library's context for reporting.
 *
 * An example of this is profiling a DRI driver which can be loaded by X
 * clients for direct rendering, or also by the X server for indirect
 * rendering. If you try and export a context variable from the GL driver to
 * the DRI driver there will end up being an unresolved symbol when the X
 * server tries to load the driver.
