/**
 * SECTION:uprof-context
 * @short_description: Group counters and timers by application/library domains
 *
 * All statistics tracked by UProf are associated with a named context
 * which usually corresponds to a single application or library.
 *
 * Contexts can be linked together at runtime if you want to report
 * relationships between the statistics between different libraries
 * and applications and because this is linking mechanism is done at
 * runtime it avoids the awkwardness of having to export special
 * profiling symbols from your libraries.
 *
 * A typical application would declare a single uprof context symbol
 * that is visible accross the whole application. So in a header you
 * could have:
 *
 * |[
 * UProfContext *_my_uprof_context;
 * ]|
 *
 * And then after initializing uprof via uprof_init() you could do:
 * |[
 * _my_uprof_context = uprof_context ("My Application");
 * ]|
 *
 * If you have a library that is mainloop based and you allow your
 * library to be a slave of an external mainloop then you should also
 * link your context to the shared mainloop. For example the Clutter
 * library can either create and manage its own mainloop or it can be
 * integrated with a mainloop created by an application. Linking to
 * the shared mainloop context can be done like this:
 * |[
 * _my_uprof_context = uprof_context ("My Application");
 * uprof_context_link (_my_uprof_context, uprof_get_mainloop_context ());
 * ]|
 *
 * At this point you can then start to declare counters and timers
 * somthing like:
 *
 * |[
 * UPROF_STATIC_COUNTER (loop_counter,
 *                       "Loop counter",
 *                       "A Counter for a loop",
 *                       0 //no application private data);
 * UPROF_COUNTER_INC (_my_uprof_context, loop_counter);
 * ]|
 *
 * See UPROF_STATIC_COUNTER() and UPROF_STATIC_TIMER() for more
 * details.

 *                        "An example parent timer",
 *                        0 // no application private data);
 *    UPROF_STATIC_TIMER (timer,
 *                        "Parent timer",
 *                        "Simple timer",
 *                        "An example timer",
 *                        0 // no application private data);
 *
 *    uprof_context_init (argc, argv);
 *
 *    context = uprof_context_new ("Test Context");
 *
 *    UPROF_TIMER_START (context, parent_timer);
 *    sleep (1);
 *    UPROF_TIMER_START (context, timer);
 *    sleep (1);
 *    UPROF_TIMER_STOP (context, timer);
 *    UPROF_TIMER_STOP (context, parent_timer);
 *
 *    report = uprof_report_new ("Test Report");
 *    uprof_report_add_context (context);
 *    uprof_report_print ();
 *    uprof_report_unref ();

 *
 * Links two contexts together so the timers and counters of the
 * @other context will become in a way part of the first @context - at
 * least as far as reporting is concerned. For example calling
 * uprof_context_foreach_counter() would iterate all the counters of
 * other contexts linked to the given context.
 *
 * One example for linking contexts is for mainloop based libraries
 * that can optionally run under the control of an external mainloop.
 * In this case where it can't be predetermined who will own the
 * mainloop UProf provides a shared context just for the purpose of
 * tracking mainloop statistics which by convention everyone should
 * use. If you need to track mainloop statistics you should link
 * UProf's mainloop context into your own. See
 * uprof_get_mainloop_context() for more details.
 *
 * Another case where linking contexts can be useful is if you are
 * profiling a library that itself dynamically loads a shared object
 * (DSO), but you can't export a context symbol from the library to
 * the DSO because it happens that this DSO is also used by other
 * libraries or applications which can't provide that symbol.
 *
 * The idea is that the DSO can create its own UProf context without
 * depending on a symbol being exported from the library and then that
 * library can get a handle on the statistics collected by that
 * library at runtime via UProf and link the DSO context into the
 * library's context for reporting.
 *
 * An example of this is profiling a DRI driver which can be loaded by X
 * clients for direct rendering, or also by the X server for indirect
 * rendering. If you try and export a context variable from the GL driver to
 * the DRI driver there will end up being an unresolved symbol when the X
 * server tries to load the driver.
